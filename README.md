# Ground Control (WIP)

Ground Control is an application to help deal with multi-repository development using a user friendly web interface.

You define workspaces in a YAML file.
A workspace contains multiple projects.
A project corresponds to a branch of a repository.

The Ground Control user interface allows you to perform operations across the projects of a workspace, including:

- Clone all repositories (defaults to `$HOME/groundcontrol/workspaces/WORKSPACE/PROJECT`)
- Check the status of repositories against their origins
- Pull all outdated repositories
- Define workspace wide tasks
- Create scripts to launch multi-repository applications
